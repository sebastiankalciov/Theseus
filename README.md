# Theseus

**Theseus** is a mobile & web application developed to compute the shortest path in a polygon and visual represent it on the web.

## Flow

- Draw on a paper a simple polygon
- Place the phone above a paper
- Take picture and send image to firebase
- Process image from firebase (opencv) then compute the graph
- Implement an algorithm to compute the shortest path
- Represent visually the shortest path on the web

Note: This is a simple representation of the app's flow

### Reference

The project's name is a Greek mythology reference to the labyrinth in which [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus) fought the Minotaur.
