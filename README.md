# Theseus

**Theseus** is a mobile application developed in **React Native** to compute the shortest path in a polygon and visual represent it using **Augmented Reality**

## Flow

- Draw on a paper a simple polygon
- Place the phone above a paper
- Process image then compute the graph
- Import the graph into the AR scene handler
- Draw the graph
- Implement an algorithm to compute the shortest path

Note: This is a simple representation of the app's flow




### Reference

The project's name is a Greek mythology reference to the labyrinth in which [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus) fought the Minotaur.
